# wpclient

wpclient is a simple client to the Wordpress API.

## Usage

Initialize a client with a username, password and API URL. You can then search for posts.

```ruby
client = Wpclient.new(url: "https://example.com/wp-json/", username: "example", password: "example")

client.posts(per_page: 5) # => [Wpclient::Post, Wpclient::Post]
```

### Creating a post

You can create posts by calling `create_post`. If you supply a ID, the article will be created using `PUT` instead of `POST`.

```ruby
data = {
  author: "Name",
  # ...
}

# POSTs the data and gets the result back
post = client.create_post(data) # => Wpclient::Post

# PUT the same data on the newly created post.
client.create_post(data.merge(id: post.id))
```

## Running tests

You need to install Docker and set it up for your machine. Note that you need `docker-machine` to run Docker on OS X.

Run tests using the normal `rspec` command after installing all bundles. The first time the integration tests are run, a docker image will be built that hosts a Wordpress installation, but the image will be re-used on subsequent runs.

```
bundle exec rspec
```
